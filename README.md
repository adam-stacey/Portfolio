# Portfolio
This repository contains comprehensive examples of the codes I have written for various courses and projects.

The C++ for Parallel Projects folder contains codes that I wrote for a parallel computing course. There are three versions of a code that solves the wave equation in second order form on an annulus using manufactured solutions and a forced wave solution. There is a serial version of the code, a version that is parallelized using OpenMP, and a version that is parallelized using MPI.

The Python for Data Science Projects folder contains codes that I wrote to study a data set containing information on a particular species of Trillium. The data set contained information on the size, habitat, and life stage of the herbs, and I used the data to classify individuals based on life stage. The codes in the folder show how I cleaned the data and then built various models to classify the individuals by life stage.
