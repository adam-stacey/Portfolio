# Portfolio
This repository contains comprehensive examples of the codes I have written for various courses and projects.

The C/C++-for-Parallel-Computing-Projects branch contains codes that I wrote for a parallel computing course. There are three versions of a code that solves the wave equation in second order form on an annulus using manufactured solutions and a forced wave soluion. There is a serial version of the code, a version that is parallelized using OpenMP, and a version that is parallelized using MPI.
